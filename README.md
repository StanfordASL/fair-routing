# Differential_Pricing
This repository contains a Python 3.7 implementation to compare the results of different traffic routing Algorithms for a fairness constrained traffic assignment problem. This repository is used in Computation of Interpolated Traffic Assignment Problems (I-TAP), which balance fairness and efficiency, as described in Jalota, Solovey, Zoepf, and Pavone: “Who Gets What and Why? A Fast Method to Balance Efficiency and Fairness in Traffic Routing”, ArXiv, 2021. In particular, the repository compares the I-TAP solution methodology with the computation of Constrained System Optimum (CSO), which balances fairness and efficiency, as described in Jahn, Möhring, Schulz, and Stier-Moses: “System-Optimal Routing of Traffic Flows with User Constraints in Networks with Congestion“, Operations Research, 2005.
